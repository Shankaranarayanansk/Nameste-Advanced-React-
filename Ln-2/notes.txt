parcel we are using all are same only they just doing the same 

parcel will ignite our app will get strength to app and parcel is like beast

__________________________________________________

npm i -d parcel (there are 2 dependency and other normal dependency -d dev dependency means developement and normal dependency is for production )

"parcel": "^2.13.0" ---caret^--->parcel will automatically update to minor  version 

"parcel": "~2.13.0" -------------------majore update but it breaks thats we use the caret insted of tilda 

it keeps the what version of package used

node-modules 

if we install the npm i parcel i will install many files thats becoz of the Transitive dependency
